### Day 25: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: <br>
 Completed 14 FreeCodeCamp exercises - Finished The Basic JavaScript section: "9 exercises" (Iterate While Loops, Profile Lookup Function, Generate Random Fractions and Whole Numbers with JavaScript, Find Numbers and spaces with Regular Expressions). <br>
 
 5 exercises of the Object Oriented and Functional Programming Section: (Declare Objects as Variables, Construct Objects with Functions, Make Instances, Make Unique Objects by Passing Parameters, Make Object Properties Private).

**Thoughts:**  I struggled with "The Profile Lookup" exercise, I had to use a reference to understand how to compare a parameter of the function to different properties of objects in a List by Iterating.

Completed 13 FreeCodeCamp exercises of JavaScript.
