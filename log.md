###Adding progress...

### Day 15: February 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
Studied Html and CSS on #Platzi. Also kept on twicking the portfolio page, added footer for contact info, changed color, looking to add animation and smooth scrolling. 

**Thoughts:** Today I wasnÂ´t feeling so good!
I feel like I can spend hours modifying things on the page to give it more details.
